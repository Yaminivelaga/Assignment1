Math Scores by Test Preparation Course Completion:
Students who completed the test preparation course performed better, with higher median math scores and fewer low outliers.

Average Final Grades by Gender:
Female students slightly outperformed male students on average, but the difference is minimal.

Distribution of Final Grades:
Most students scored between 60 and 80, following a normal distribution.

Math Scores by Parental Level of Education: 
Students with parents having higher education levels generally scored better in math, though there is variability.

Distribution of Race/Ethnicity:
Group C is the largest, followed by Groups D and B, with Groups A and E being smaller.

I found that the boxplot and barplot were the most effective for comparing performance metrics, 
such as math scores and final grades, as they clearly highlighted differences between groups.
The histogram worked well for understanding the overall distribution of grades, while the pie chart was useful for showcasing proportions,
such as race/ethnicity distribution. Overall, the boxplot stood out as the most suitable for providing detailed insights with variability
and outliers clearly represented.
